# Go-LeftPad
Ever wondered why simple things are so complicated? Me too. Which is why I've taken the best from Node.js and brought it to Go.

Welcome to the marvel of unnecessity. Introducing "go-leftpad", because why not?

## Description
"Turning Go into Node" - I heard you liked to use tiny Node packages for everything, so I've made a Go package for one simple function. Now you can pretend you're in JavaScript land, but with the speed and efficiency of Go!

## Installation
Don't even sweat. As simple as a Kardashian's life:

```
go get github.com/briandoesdev/go-leftpad
```

## Usage
Who knew left padding could be so fun... and unnecessary?
```
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/briandoesdev/go-leftpad"
)

func main() {
    // Outputs: "   42"
	fmt.Println(leftpad("42", 5, ' ')) 
}

```

## FAQ
__Q: Why Go-LeftPad?__

     Because coding should be fun, even if it means making fun of ourselves!

__Q: Why would I need this in Go?__

     You don't. But can you resist the charm of this tiny, simple and absolutely unnecessary module? I think not!

__Q: Why did you?__

     I ask that everyday to myself.

And remember, I don't believe in making things simple. Why have less, when you can have more?
